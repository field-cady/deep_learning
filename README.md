This is a folder of example AI projects.
They are me playing around with different AI-related
technologies at various points.

# Language App

This is for learning Chinese.
It keeps track of Chinese words that I know and ones that I am working on,
and uses an LLM API to compose sentences that
* Use exactly one word I am learning, and
* Otherwise are all words that I know

# Chatbot

This is a simple RAG system that pulls information
out of some PDFs.
It uses LangChain and the FAISS stack.
