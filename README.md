This is a folder of example AI projects.
They are me playing around with different AI-related
technologies at various points.

# Language App

This is for learning Chinese.
It keeps track of Chinese words that I know and ones that I am working on,
using an LLM to compose sentences that
* Use exactly one word I am learning, and
* Otherwise are all words that I know

It uses the OpenAI API.

# Langchain Examples

This uses LangChain and the FAISS stack locally,
in increasing levels of complexity:
* Free text, starting from initial words
* Question-answer with a prompt, which is impressive but also hallucinates
* RAG, which gets the right answers to the questions that previously hallucinated
